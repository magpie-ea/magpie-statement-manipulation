- ran two batches on Prolific (each with intended 20 people)
- first batch recorded the input stimulus (matrix/table of marks and crosses) wrongly, it seems
- second batch does that right
- could use data from both sets to see whether the manipulations (high/low framing, probability of success (=bias)) have effects on choices
- paid 1 pound (estimated 8 min, but that might have been too optimistic)
